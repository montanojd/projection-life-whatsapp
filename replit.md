# System Architecture

## Backend Architecture
The application follows a modular Express.js architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Entry Point**: `server.js` serves as the main application entry point with middleware configuration
- **Route Handling**: RESTful API structure with dedicated webhook routes in `/routes/webhook.js`
- **Service Layer**: Business logic separated into specialized services for message handling, conversation management, and response templates
- **Middleware Layer**: Custom webhook verification middleware for security and request validation
- **Utility Layer**: Shared utilities for logging and message parsing

## Message Processing Pipeline
The system implements a sophisticated message processing pipeline:

1. **Webhook Verification**: Validates incoming WhatsApp webhook requests using signature verification and token validation
2. **Message Parsing**: Intelligent intent recognition using keyword matching and context analysis
3. **Conversation Management**: Stateful conversation tracking with session data and context preservation
4. **Response Generation**: Template-based response system with interactive buttons and structured messages
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging and graceful failure handling

## Security Implementation
- **Webhook Verification**: HMAC-SHA256 signature validation for incoming requests
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in protection against message flooding
- **Environment Configuration**: Secure credential management through environment variables
- **Request Validation**: Payload structure validation before processing

## Conversation State Management
The system maintains conversation context through:
- **Session Tracking**: User preferences, language settings, and service types
- **State Machine**: Conversation flow management with states like INITIAL, SERVICE_SELECTION, APPOINTMENT_BOOKING
- **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of expired conversations to prevent memory leaks
- **Message History**: Conversation log storage for context-aware responses

## Medical Service Classification
Specialized keyword-based classification for:
- **PAD Services**: Peripheral arterial disease consultation and treatment
- **Nursing Services**: Home healthcare and nursing support
- **General Consultations**: Medical appointments and specialist referrals
- **Emergency Detection**: Priority handling for urgent medical situations
